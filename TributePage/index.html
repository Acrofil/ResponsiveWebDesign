                <ul id="tribute">
                    <li>Atanasoff was born on October 4, 1903 in Hamilton, New York to an electrical engineer and a
                        school teacher. Atanasoff's father, Ivan Atanasoff was of Bulgarian origin,
                    </li>
                    <li>Atanasoff was raised in Brewster, Florida. At the age of nine he learned to use a slide
                        rule, followed shortly by the study of logarithms, and subsequently completed high school at
                        Mulberry High School in two years. In 1925, Atanasoff received his bachelor of science
                        degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, graduating with straight
                        A's.
                    </li>
                    <li>He continued his education at Iowa State College and in 1926 earned a master's degree in
                        mathematics. He completed his formal education in 1930 by earning a Ph.D. in theoretical
                        physics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with his thesis, The Dielectric Constant of
                        Helium. Upon completion of his doctorate, Atanasoff accepted an assistant professorship at
                        Iowa State College in mathematics and physics.
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <p class="headline">Computer development</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 1936 he invented an analog calculator for analyzing surface geometry. At this point he
                        was pushing the boundaries of what gears could do and the fine mechanical tolerance required
                        for good accuracy pushed him to consider digital solutions.</li>
                    <li>With a grant of $650 received in September 1939 and the assistance of his graduate student
                        Clifford Berry, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer (ABC) was prototyped by November of that year.
                    </li>
                    <li>The ABC had no central processing unit (CPU), but was designed as an electronic device using
                        vacuum tubes for digital computation. It also had regenerative capacitor memory that
                        operated by a process similar to that used today in DRAM memory.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Between 1954 and 1973, Atanasoff was a witness in the legal actions brought by various
                        parties to invalidate electronic computing patents issued to Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert,
                        which were owned by computer manufacturer Sperry Rand. In the 1973 decision of Honeywell v.
                        Sperry Rand, a federal judge named Atanasoff the inventor of the electronic digital
                        computer.</li>

                <p class="headline">Honors and distinctions</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Atanasoff's first national award for scientific achievements was the Order of Saints Cyril
                        and Methodius, First Class, Bulgaria's highest scientific honor bestowed to him in 1970.
                    </li>
                    <li>In 1990, President George H. W. Bush awarded Atanasoff the United States National Medal of
                        Technology, the highest U.S. honor conferred for achievements related to technological
                        progress.
